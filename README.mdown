# Pericope

Pericope is a gem for parsing Bible references (and in this repo, modified for Book of Mormon references as well).

It recognizes common abbreviations and misspellings for names of the books of the Bible and a variety of ways of denoting ranges of chapters and verses. It can parse pericopes singly or out of a block of text. It's useful for comparing two pericopes for intersection and normalizing them into a well-formatted string.

## Examples

##### Recognize common abbreviations and misspellings for names of the books of the Bible

```ruby
  Pericope.new("ps 118:17").to_s # => Psalm 118:17
  Pericope.new("jas 3:1-5").to_s # => James 3:1-5
  Pericope.new("1 ne 12:4").to_s  # => 1 Nephi 12:4
```

##### Compare two pericopes to see if they intersect

```ruby
  a = Pericope.new("Mark 13:1-6")
  b = Pericope.new("Mark 13:5")
  c = Pericope.new("Mark 13:6, 7")
  
  a.intersects?(b) # => true
  a.intersects?(c) # => true
  b.intersects?(c) # => false
```

##### Parse pericopes out of a block of text

```ruby
  text = <<-TEXT
  If then, the Word is so significant, great important attaches to its exact form. It has the form of a promise as in Isaiah 43:1: "Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine," or as in Luke 2:10-11, "Do not be afraid..to you is born this day...a Savior." (Bayer, p51)
  TEXT
  
  Pericope.parse(text) # => [Isaiah 43:1, Luke 2:10-11]
  
  Pericope.split(text) # => ["  If then, the Word is so significant, great important attaches to its exact form. It has the form of a promise as in ", Isaiah 43:1, ": \"Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine,\" or as in ", Luke 2:10-11, ", \"Do not be afraid..to you is born this day...a Savior.\" (Bayer, p51)\n"]
```

##### Converts pericopes into arrays of verses and reconstructs them from arrays of verses

```ruby
  array = Pericope.new("gen 1:1-3").to_a # => [1001001, 1001002, 1001003]
  Pericope.new(array) # => Genesis 1:1-3
```


## History

##### 0.6.1

 - Deprecated the `report` and `extract` methods (they will be removed in 0.7.0)

##### 0.6.0

 - Removed the `index` attribute
 - Deprecated the `pattern` argument to the method `Pericope.split(text, pattern=nil)` (it will be removed in 0.7.0)
 - Improved performance by 2x
 - Added this README
 - Fixed a bug with parsing inverted [invalid] ranges (e.g. Mark 3-1)
